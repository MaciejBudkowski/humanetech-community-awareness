## Summary 

<!-- Clear and concise explanation in 1-3 lines of text. -->

This video demonstrates how social norms and communications have eroded by smartphones.

## Goals

<!-- Bullet list of the intended effects of the deliverable, separated by empty lines. -->

- Demonstrate clearly how society used to be, how it is now, and what it is becoming

- Leave clear impression of values we are losing, by being unaware of our tech use

- Make a video that is not bound to a language or region, can be shown globally

## Concept

<!-- Describe the concept, the moral, underlying ideas of the video (one or more paragraphs of text) -->

You often hear "In the old days, things used to be better". This is not always the case. but in terms of our social interactions and how they are influenced by social media and smartphone tech, it really is.

We want to make that crystal clear, by showing a timeline play in a lively bar, where we skip through the decades, show moments of delight and festivity. When approaching the present day there is less and less of that anymore, as smartphones appear in the hands of the clientele. The video ends in the near future, where the bar has gone bust and the furnature is covered with sheets and cobwebs.

The question finally posed to the viewer is "Do you really want this?".

## Strategy

<!--Additional strategy requirements to what is outlined in the campaign. Use this placeholder text if this section is not needed:

- This deliverable does not require additional strategy. Please refer to [campaign strategy](url-to-campaign-readme#strategy).
 -->

- In addition to the campaign strategy we will market this video on Whatsapp, as something cool to share.

## Script

<!-- Summary of the script of the video (multiple paragraphs, providing details). Update/refine the script as it evolves, incorporating feedback. The sample text below shows how detailed this should get. -->

The video starts in the 50's, with a steady-cam shot going through the door of a lively bar. There is a lively atmosphere and many guests. The camera goes straight to the barman, who smiles broadly while cleaning a glass.

In the next shot, we see the barman from the back and the year 1958 appears. The video speeds up, and we see the years pass by in a couple of seconds, showing quick flashes of people in different settings in the bar. The video slows again at 1968, where we see a wedding party with people dancing to live music from a band in the corner, uproarous laughter.

[...]

Now when the video slows we are in 2018. The bar is mostly silent, while it is still filled with people. On every table we see smartphones, people showing their screen to the person next to them, not aware of others in the bar. We still see the barman from the back. He is trying to draw attention from a guest whose drink is waiting on the counter. Eventually he has to raise his voice. The viewer can deduce that he has lost some luster and joy in his work.

Now the years click by slowly one by one, with sped up video fragments showing the same quiet people, phone zombies really. There are less people too. We end in 2021 when suddenly the bar is empty, furniture is covered in sheets. The bar is forever closed. The barman has quit. This was not his calling.

The camera that was behind the counter all the time now slowly pans into the bar, going along the walls where many photo frames have been hung over the years. They show the good moments of the past, The Days of Old. When reading the door, the steady-cam slowly goes outside, only to nearly avoid collision to a young passer-by who is absorbed in his phone. The person mumbles something ineligible and walks on. The street outside is empty, save for one person walking with AR glasses on her face, playing some game.

No slowly the large text "Do you really want this?" fades into view. The camera pans down, showing the pavement and a hand appears holding a smartphone. The smartphone has a screen only showing a big 'Off' button. The hand's thumb presses it, and with a blimp the video goes to black. CHT logo + URL appears followed by credit roll.

## Duration

<!-- Indicator on how long the video should be (one or more bullets) -->

- Short, maximum duration of 3 mins.

## Music

<!-- Plan for the music that is likely to be used in the video. -->

The video has one music themes that is used from beginning to end and in all sped up scenes. At first this is upbeat (but not too distracting), and later it gets more silent, somber.

When the video slows to depict individual events every decade, the music is dependent on the scene that is depicted. The last part of the video - when the camera goes outside again - has the same 50's style music (classical?) as at the start, but at a more melancholic stage of the song.

Actual music we can use should still be determined.

## Production

## Funding

<!-- (optional) Financial requirements, required budget, ways to obtain funds (keep it short, couple of paragraphs, some bullets). If necessary link to separate detailed funding document. Use the placeholder text if no funding is required. -->
