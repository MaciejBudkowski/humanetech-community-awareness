## Summary 

<!-- Clear and concise explanation in 1-3 lines of text -->

Simple measures can greatly increase digital wellbeing, once people are aware of their tech habits.

## Topics

<!-- Bullet list with (humane) tech topics and/or harms that are targeted -->

- Prolonged screen use
- Tech habits
- Digital wellbeing

## Objectives

<!-- Bullet list of what to achieve with the campaigns in this theme, separated by empty lines. -->

- Create awareness of the harms of prolonged screen use.

- Draw attention on ways to change behavior and habits with simple exercises.

## Description

<!-- A longer, more elaborate description (one or more paragraphs of text) -->

We spend way to much time staring at our screens, be it on smartphones or laptops. This has serious consequences for our health. People develop sleep disorders, eyestrain and even blindness, and a humpback neck.

A little more awareness of our behavior could already do wonders, and there are many easy to apply exercises and tips to change habits and behavior and alleviate problems before they occur.

## Strategy

<!-- (optional) If there is a common strategy, outline it here (one or more paragraphs of text, use formatting - like lists - where appropriate). Leave the placeholder text if this section is not needed. -->

- This theme does not require a high-level strategy. Strategies can be found on individual campaigns.
