## Description

<!-- A longer, more elaborate description (one or more paragraphs of text) -->

This campaign is focused on providing solutions to people that are at risk, or suffering from, health problems related to their use of technology (smartphones, laptops, screens). To make improvement of their habits and behavior actionable and easy.

Among the deliverables are one or more video channels (e.g. on YouTube, Vimeo and PeerTube) where exercise videos are published on a regular basis, like bi-weekly. The exercises should be short and simple, and focus on habit-forming and behavior change. The exercise video's can be interspersed by video's where medical experts, tech addicts, and 'rehabilitated' people are interviewed. The video channel(s) can also be used as a conduit to attract attention to other Humane Tech community campaigns.

Part of the campaign is an intricate marketing and promotion strategy across all popular social media channels, to increase popularity and subscriptions to the video channel(s). We want to reach a large audience in short time, and keep growing afterwards.
